<p>Welcome to my website! I was born right here in Maine, a small town called Bucksport. I've lived there all of my life. I'm very excited to be attending the University of Maine.

<p>One of my many passions include sports. Throughout highschool, I played four sports: baseball, basketball, soccer and football. I've been on varsity for each sport since freshman year. In 2013, the Bucksport Highschool Baseball team made it to the Eastern Maine Championship earning runners up. In 2014, we made it to Maine State class C Championship where we also runners up. The next two years of highschool baseball, we made Eastern Maine's one more time also getting runners up. Junior year and Senior year, I was elected as team captain. We also made Eastern Maine's in Basketball my Junior year. We were also given runners up. I didn't really get much playing time the first 3 years of highschool, but my senior year I was a starter, a captain, and also led the team captain. I was elected as third team all conference at the end of the year. We didn't get to the tournament that year, but it was still a great year. In soccer, we weren't so lucky. In fact, we didn't win a game in two years. The crazy thing is, we still made the playoffs both years. My one year of football, we made it to Eastern Maine's and also received runners up. I didn't play very much, but it was still a very good learning experience. Even though we never got a state title in any of the sports that I played, it was still the most fun time of my life. Just being involved, being around people that were like family, made it a lifelong learning experience. At the end of my senior year, on class night I was awarded Student Athelete of the Year.

<p> Throughout my life, my family has been very supportive of me. Shortly after I was born, my family moved to Bucksport from Corinth. I don't remember what my home there even looked like. My mom is a Mainer just like me, she was born and raised here. She went to medical school and has worked at Eastern Maine Medical Center for 15 years. I've always been super close to my mom, as a child, I was always tied to her hip. My dad was born in Scotland, he moved to America when he was 6 years old. He still partially carries that thick Scottish accent with him to this day. My dad went to Beal College for Law enforcement and is now Parking Security manager at Eastern Maine Medical Center. Him and I have also been very close. Something I will always remember will be when I was younger, he always would let us ride in his World War 2 era military jeep. Growing up outside of town, I didn't have a lot of friends to hangout with. That's where my brother came in. When we were little, we were bestfriends. Whether it be playing with his Star Wars toys, or playing the playstation, we were always happy and laughing. When he grew up a little bit, he began to become really mean. That's just how teenagers were. Now that he's in college, and I'm also in college. We are getting along again and it's amazing.

<p> I have a few hobbies that I've done for the majority of my life. One of my hobbies would be playing catch. My childhood consisted of playing catch with my father, or little league teammates. I wouldn't leave the house without a ball and a glove.  I believe that playing catch every single day made me a better ball player. Another one of my hobbies is shoes. I wouldn't say that I am a sneaker collector, but I always make sure that I have at least 3 pairs of shoes that I wear on a daily basis. I always get a nice pair of basketball shoes and never throw them out. I still wear my shoes from sophomore year. When I started elementary school, my parents bought me a playstation 2. When I wasn't at school, I was playing it. That thing was my entire child hood. To this day, I still play video games. My girlfriend may not like it, but it's what I've always done. I don't play very many games, but the ones I play are: 

<ul> 
<LI> Call of Duty</LI> 
<LI> NBA 2K</LI>
<LI> Madden</LI>
</ul>
